This is more of a test post than anything else. I've been meaning to get a new website up and running for some time now and here it is.

<br />
Hosted on Github for free, and easy to edit by just editing markdown files and pushing them to Github, this site should be easy to maintain. 

<br />
Since Jekyll also works well for blog posts, I said I'd give this a go and see if I get a chance to write much. I may write something about the setting up of this site from scratch and setting up a local environment to test on. 

<br />
Keep an eye out!
