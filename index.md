I'm an Electronic & Computer Engineering graduate from [NUI Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie/). I completed my undergraduate degree in May 2018 and I'm currently working in the Artificial Intelligence group at [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/) as a member of the Data Science team.

<br />
This is my personal website, and includes some information on the experience and skills I have in the [CV](http://cathalbreathnach.com/cv) section. I've also included some detail on a few of the [projects](http://cathalbreathnach.com/projects) I've worked on. You can download a PDF copy of my CV by clicking [here]({{cathalbreathnach.com}}/documents/Cathal_Breathnach_CV.pdf).

<br />
I am interested in applying my experience to solving relevant real-world problems by implementing innovative engineering approaches. I have a particular interest in designing practical solutions using artificial intelligence and next-generation technologies but I also enjoy gaining an understanding of the theory and mathematics that describe problems. I am well organised with a persistent attention to detail and can apply concepts at a high performance level.

<br />
Some more information is available on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathalbreathnach/) or you can also take at look at some of my work contained in my [Github](http://github.com/cbreathnach) repositories.

<br />
I enjoy spending my spare time in the outdoors and time spent mountaineering and Scouting has brought me all over the world on a wide variety of adventures. I value the amount you can learn from visiting a new place and by putting yourself outside your comfort zone. I also enjoy running, play the piano and read quite a few books.
