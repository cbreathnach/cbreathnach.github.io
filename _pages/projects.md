Below is a list of some of the projects I have worked on including some detail on each. 

### Advanced Particle Swarm Optimisation Techniques - Final Year Project

I am currently working on this project as I work towards the completion of my undergraduate degree. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a heuristic, stochastic optimisation algorithm. I am researching new implementations of PSO algorithms to achieve better performance across a wider range of optimisation problems by comparing results to benchmarked standards.

<br />
The project has involved:
* Researching and writing a literary review on Particle Swarm Optimisation and its applications.
* Developing a Java simulator to implement and test standard algorithms to match available results. The simulator has been designed for performance and extensibility, which has been achieved using Java's object-object nature and built-in support for multi-threading. 
* Designing new algorithms by identifying areas of possible improvement.

### Activity-Monitor Android Application 

An Android application developed to monitor a user's step count and locations and display them in an easy-to-use application. User locations are displayed on a Google Maps screen and the steps are displayed in a scrollable table view. A Firebase back-end was used to store user data while JobService classes were used to monitor the user locations and step count using location listeners and the built-in API functions for counting steps on Android.

The Android project is available [here](https://github.com/cbreathnach/ActivityMonitor) on Github.

### JavaLearner - An implementation of a Logistic Regression Classifier in Java

Developed a GUI for a logistic regression machine learning implementation written from scratch, achieving approximately 95% accuracy on the iris data set and other tested data set. It was written Java being the language I am most familiar with and could be easily extended in the future. Python would also have been a good choice as handling data in numpy arrays could have been easier. I also spent some time learning how to use the Scikit-learn libraries along with Weka and RapidMiner for analysis of data.

<br />
The code for the JavaLearner application is available [here](https://github.com/cbreathnach/JavaLearner) on Github.

### Bluetooth-Enabled Electromechanical Xylophone using Arduino

This project was completed in my second year of Engineering as part of our microprocessor systems engineering module. The task was to design an electronic musical instrument using Arduino. The project featured a xylophone played by electromagnetic relay drumsticks controlled wirelessly using a Bluetooth enabled glove using force sensitive resistors. Two Arduino boards were used, connected using two bluetooth modules. The xylophone had a manual playing mode, could play back built-in songs and could also record songs that could later be played back by the user.

<br />
This was a top scoring project from the class and I made significant contribution to the hardware and software design, working specifically on the glove design and software, on the bluetooth transmission algorithm and on the recording functionality.

<br />
A video of the project in action can be viewed [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136158919@N08/shares/0z028R) and the Arduino C code is also available on Github [here](https://github.com/cbreathnach/BluetoothXylophone).
